Violation ID: aria-valid-attr-value
Description: Ensures all ARIA attributes have valid values
Help: ARIA attributes must conform to valid values
Help URL: https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.1/aria-valid-attr-value?application=axeAPI
Why it matters: ARIA attributes (i.e. starting with aria-) must contain valid values. These values must be spelled correctly and correspond to values that make sense for a particular attribute to perform the intended accessibility function. Many ARIA attributes accept a specific set of values. Allowed values, acceptable "undefined" values, and acceptable "default" values are required. Failure to comply with allowed values results in content that is not accessible to assistive technology users.

Violation ID: color-contrast
Description: Ensures the contrast between foreground and background colors meets WCAG 2 AA contrast ratio thresholds
Help: Elements must have sufficient color contrast
Help URL: https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.1/color-contrast?application=axeAPI
Why it matters: Some people with low vision experience low contrast, meaning that there aren't very many bright or dark areas. Everything tends to appear about the same brightness, which makes it hard to distinguish outlines, borders, edges, and details. Text that is too close in luminance (brightness) to the background can be hard to read. There are nearly three times more individuals with low vision than those with total blindness. One in twelve people cannot see the average full spectrum of colors - about 8% of men and 0.4% of women in the US. A person with low vision or color blindness is unable to distinguish text against a background without sufficient contrast. Color transparency and opacity is taken into account in the background. Color transparency and opacity in the foreground is more difficult to detect and account for due to: 1:1 colors in foreground and background. CSS background gradients. Background colors in CSS pseudo-elements. Background colors created with CSS borders. Overlap by another element in the foreground - this sometimes comes up with tricky positioning. Elements moved outside the viewport via CSS.

Violation ID: heading-order
Description: Ensures the order of headings is semantically correct
Help: Heading levels should only increase by one
Help URL: https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.1/heading-order?application=axeAPI
Why it matters: The underlying purpose of headers is to convey the structure of the page. For sighted users, the same purpose is achieved using different sizes of text. Text size, however, is not helpful for users of screen readers, because a screen reader identifies a header only if it is properly marked-up. When heading elements are applied correctly, the page becomes much easier to navigate for screen reader users and sighted users alike. In the same way that sighted users can glance at a page and get a sense of its contents, users of screen readers can do the same by navigating through headings. Well written and properly ordered headings can save users, especially those who use screen readers, a lot of time and frustration. The purpose of headings is to describe the structure of the webpage, not just highlight important text. They should be brief, clear, unique, and marked with h1 through h6 elements applied in hierarchical order. All of these qualities make headings valuable tools for screen reader users. Similar to the way sighted users can glance at a page and get a sense of its contents, screen reader users can navigate through headings. Well written and properly ordered headings can save screen reader time and frustration. In addition to making the page more accessible, headings have other benefits since search engines use headings when filtering, ordering, and displaying results. Improving the accessibility of your site can also have the effect of making your page more findable.

Violation ID: landmark-one-main
Description: Ensures the page has only one main landmark and each iframe in the page has at most one main landmark
Help: Page must have one main landmark
Help URL: https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.1/landmark-one-main?application=axeAPI
Why it matters: Navigating a web page is far simpler for screen reader users if all of the content splits between one or more high-level sections. Content outside of these sections is difficult to find, and its purpose may be unclear. HTML has historically lacked some key semantic markers, such as the ability to designate sections of the page as the header, navigation, main content, and footer. Using both HTML5 elements and ARIA landmarks in the same element is considered a best practice, but the future will favor HTML regions as browser support increases.

Violation ID: link-name
Description: Ensures links have discernible text
Help: Links must have discernible text
Help URL: https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.1/link-name?application=axeAPI
Why it matters: Inaccessible link elements pose barriers to accessibility, as they are a fundamental component of a website. Users who rely exclusively on a keyboard (and no mouse) to navigate a webpage can only click on links that can receive programmatic focus. A link that cannot receive programmatic focus is inaccessible to these users. Like sighted users, screen reader users need to know where a link is pointing. Inner link text provides this information, though it won't get used if a screen reader can't access it. Keyboard users, including visually impaired screen reader users or people who cannot use a mouse, can activate only the links and form elements that can receive programmatic focus. Any events activated exclusively by other types of focus, for example onmouseover events that depend on the mouse hover focus, are inaccessible to keyboard users. Only links and form elements receive keyboard focus by default. Modify elements that are not links or form components to receive focus by adding tabindex="0".

Violation ID: meta-viewport
Description: Ensures <meta name="viewport"> does not disable text scaling and zooming
Help: Zooming and scaling must not be disabled
Help URL: https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.1/meta-viewport?application=axeAPI
Why it matters: The user-scalable="no" parameter inside the content attribute of <meta name="viewport"> element disables zooming on a page. The maximum-scale parameter limits the amount the user can zoom. This is problematic for people with low vision who rely on screen magnifiers to properly see the contents of a web page. Users with partial vision and low vision often choose to enlarge the fonts on their browser to make text on the web easier to read. The browser's viewport focus is everything visible in the browser window at a given moment. Maximizing the browser to full size on a high-resolution monitor creates a large the viewport focus area and may include the entire web page. If the browser window is small, the viewport focus area only includes a small part of the web page. The browser's viewport focus does not affect the programmatic focus. Users can scroll up and down the web page, but the programmatic focus does not follow the viewport. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines calls for developers to design pages so that they support resize up to 200%. Ensures that the user-scalable="no" parameter is not present in the <meta name="viewport"> element and the maximum-scale parameter is not less than 2.

Violation ID: page-has-heading-one
Description: Ensure that the page, or at least one of its frames contains a level-one heading
Help: Page must contain a level-one heading
Help URL: https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.1/page-has-heading-one?application=axeAPI
Why it matters: Screen reader users can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate directly to the first h1, which, in principle, should allow them to jump directly to the main content of the web page. If there is no h1, or if the h1 appears somewhere other than at the start of the main content, screen reader users must listen to more of the web page to understand its structure, wasting valuable time. Keep in mind that blind users can't just look at a web page and immediately understand its layout the way that a visual user can. Visual users can take in much information about the page layout without having to read all of the content. Blind users don't have that luxury. Screen readers read linearly, which means listening to the entire web page unless there is some other convenient way to get a "glimpse" of the page's layout and structure. It turns out that headings are a way to do that. Screen reader users can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the heading structure of a document.

Violation ID: region
Description: Ensures all page content is contained by landmarks
Help: All page content must be contained by landmarks
Help URL: https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.1/region?application=axeAPI
Why it matters: Navigating a web page is far simpler for screen reader users if the content splits between multiple high-level sections. Content outside of sections is difficult to find, and the content's purpose may be unclear. Historically, HTML lacked some key semantic markers such as the ability to designate sections of the page as the header, navigation, main content, and footer. Using both HTML5 elements and ARIA landmarks in the same element is considered a best practice, but the future favors using native HTML5 element regions as browser support increases.
